        div -a block level tag
        span - a inline tag without specific meaning of its own (unlike other inline tags like strong, i , small)
        Difference between SPAN and DIV 
        As we have already learnt that <div> is a block-level element whereas <span> is an inline element. 
        And we have studied the differences too, now lets practically see the difference. 
        We will be focussing on the following two features : 
            <div> always starts with new line, while <span> doesnt. 
            <div> takes on the full available width while <span> doesnt. 
            Then we will add the div with some text, and you will see that 
              the text enclosed by opening and closing <div> tag will appear in new line.
